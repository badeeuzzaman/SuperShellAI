# Description
SuperShell AI is an advanced penetration testing tool that creates highly obfuscated PowerShell reverse shell payloads with integrated AI-powered evasion techniques. This tool leverages DeepSeek AI to generate polymorphic payloads that can bypass modern EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) solutions and antivirus software.

# Features
üöÄ AI-Powered Obfuscation: Utilizes DeepSeek AI to create advanced evasion techniques.

üîÄ Multiple Payload Types: Support for standard PowerShell, Nishang-style, and CMD.exe reverse shells.

üõ°Ô∏è EDR Evasion: Implements techniques like string splitting, encryption, and API unhooking.

üîÑ Polymorphic Generation: Creates unique payload signatures with each generation.

üíæ Export Options: Save payloads to files with customizable names.

üìã One-Liner Generation: Creates compact commands for easy execution.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/badeeuzzaman/supershellai.git
cd supershellai
```
2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Get a DeepSeek API key from https://platform.deepseek.com/

# Usage
Run the script:
```bash
python supershellai.py
```
Follow the interactive prompts to:
1. Enter your listener IP address and port
2. Provide your DeepSeek API key
3. Select generation mode (Basic, AI-powered, or Polymorphic)
4. Choose shell type (PowerShell, Nishang, or CMD)
5. Specify output filename

# Generation Modes
1. Basic Obfuscation: Local obfuscation without API calls
2. AI-Powered Obfuscation: Enhanced obfuscation using DeepSeek AI
3. Polymorphic Generation: Completely unique payload generation using AI

# Shell Types
1. Standard PowerShell: Classic PowerShell reverse shell
2. Nishang-style: Enhanced reverse shell with error handling
3. CMD.exe: Traditional command prompt reverse shell
